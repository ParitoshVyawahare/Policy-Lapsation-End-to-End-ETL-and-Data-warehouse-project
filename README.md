# 🏦 Data Warehousing and ETL for Policy Lapsation in Life Insurance  

## 📖 Project Overview  
Policy lapsation poses a significant challenge in the **life insurance sector**, occurring when policyholders miss premium payments, leading to policy termination. This not only impacts customers, who lose financial security, but also insurance providers, who face revenue loss and increased reacquisition costs.  

One of the primary difficulties in addressing lapsation is the **fragmentation of data** across multiple channels such as **web sales, agents, and banking partners**. The lack of a unified data strategy makes it difficult for companies to **identify at-risk customers early** and take proactive measures.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
This project focuses on developing a **centralized data warehousing and ETL solution** that integrates **multi-source data** to enhance **decision-making and policy retention strategies**. The goal is to provide a **structured, accurate, and actionable data-driven framework** to reduce policy lapsation.  

## 🔑 Key Features  
✅ **End-to-End ETL Pipeline** – Aggregates and processes structured & unstructured data, including:  
   - **Static Data** (e.g., agent details, policy types, branch information).  
   - **Dynamic Data** (e.g., premium payments, policy statuses, customer interactions).  

✅ **Synthetic Data Simulation** – Generates real-world policyholder behaviors, agent interactions, and transactional updates to test system performance.  

✅ **Data Warehousing** – Stores **cleaned, transformed, and integrated data** in a structured format, optimizing accessibility and analysis.  

✅ **Business Intelligence Insights** – Enables customer segmentation, agent performance tracking, policy trend analysis, and payment optimization for **strategic decision-making**.  

## 🔍 Expected Outcomes  
🔹 **A fully functional ETL pipeline** integrating multi-source data.  
🔹 **A structured data warehouse** for efficient reporting and analysis.  
🔹 **Interactive dashboards** to visualize lapsation trends and key insights.  
🔹 **Predictive analytics** to identify at-risk policyholders and improve retention strategies.  

## 🚀 Impact  
By implementing a **data-driven approach**, this project aims to **enhance customer retention, reduce policy lapsation, and optimize business operations** in the life insurance industry.
