![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44601a65-e803-49ab-b021-adfe33c4e3b3)


## 📖 Project Overview  
Policy lapsation is a major challenge in the **life insurance industry**, occurring when policyholders fail to pay premiums, leading to policy termination. This negatively impacts both **customers** (who lose financial security) and **insurance providers** (who face revenue loss and increased reacquisition costs).  

A key issue is **data fragmentation** across multiple sources such as **web sales, agents, and banking partners**, making it difficult to **detect at-risk customers early** and take corrective action. This project aims to create a **centralized data warehousing solution** to unify and analyze data, enabling **better decision-making and retention strategies**.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
This project focuses on **building an ETL pipeline** that integrates **multi-source data** into a **PostgreSQL-based data warehouse**, facilitating structured reporting and predictive insights. The goal is to create an **efficient, scalable, and actionable data-driven framework** to reduce policy lapsation.

## 🔑 Key Features  
✅ **ETL Pipeline using Talend** – Extracts, transforms, and loads structured & unstructured data, including:  
   - **Static Data** (e.g., agent details, policy types, branch information).  
   - **Dynamic Data** (e.g., premium payments, policy statuses, customer interactions).  

✅ **Synthetic Data Simulation** – Generates realistic datasets representing policy purchases, agent interactions, and payment trends for testing and validation.  

✅ **Data Warehousing with PostgreSQL** – Stores **cleaned, transformed, and integrated data** in a structured format, ensuring **efficient querying and analysis**.  

✅ **Database Planning with Draw.io** – Designed **logical and conceptual schemas** to optimize data modeling and relationships.  

✅ **Business Intelligence & Predictive Insights** – Enables:  
   - **Customer segmentation & churn prediction**.  
   - **Agent performance tracking**.  
   - **Payment method optimization**.  
   - **Trend forecasting to reduce policy lapsation**.

## 🔍 Expected Outcomes  
🔹 **Fully functional ETL pipeline** integrating diverse data sources.  
🔹 **Well-structured data warehouse** for accurate and fast reporting.  
🔹 **Interactive dashboards** to visualize policy lapsation trends.  
🔹 **Predictive analytics** to identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.
